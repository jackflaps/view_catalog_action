# View Catalog Action Button

Adds a button to resource views in the ArchivesSpace public site so that a user may click through the library catalog, where they can view holdings and determine availability of collection materials.

This plugin assumes catalog keys are kept in `string_1` in the User Defined fields in ArchivesSpace. Currently, to update this you will need to edit the plugin code directly. Ideally it would be configurable.
